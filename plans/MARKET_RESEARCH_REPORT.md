- Approval of previous meeting minutes
- Discussion summaries for each agenda item
- Motions made and voting results
- Action items assigned
- Next meeting date
- Adjournment time

**Best Practice:** "Could someone unfamiliar with the meeting understand what was discussed and decided?"

#### Step 4: Voting and Decisions
**In-Meeting Voting:**
- Motion made and seconded (recorded)
- Discussion period
- Call for vote
- Real-time polling (if electronic)
- Record yes/no/abstain votes
- Document outcome and vote tally
- Note absent members during vote (SOX/governance requirement)

**Asynchronous Voting:**
- Distribute voting item via platform
- Set voting deadline
- Track participation
- Automatic reminders to non-voters
- Results revealed at deadline or when complete

**Approval Workflows:**
- eSignature collection
- Approval routing (sequential or parallel)
- Status tracking
- Automatic notifications on completion

#### Step 5: Action Item Assignment
**During Meeting:**

- Clarify deliverable and specifics
- Document in minutes

**End-of-Meeting Review:**
- Chair verbally summarizes all action items
- Confirm assignees and deadlines
- Opportunity for clarification
- Board consensus on realism of deadlines

**Best Practice:** "Pass the stranger test" - Write action items so someone unfamiliar could understand exactly what needs to be done

### 5.5 Post-Meeting Follow-Up (Action Items, Approvals)

#### Step 1: Minutes Approval
- Secretary drafts minutes (or AI generates draft)
- Chair reviews and approves
- Distribute to committee for review
- Comment period (typically 5-7 days)
- Incorporate feedback
- Formal approval (next meeting or electronic)
- Archive approved minutes

**Timeline:** Distribute minutes within 3-5 days of meeting

#### Step 2: Action Item Management
**Track and Monitor Phase:**

- How directors view their roles
- Satisfaction with board functioning
- Individual development needs
- Committee effectiveness

**Assessment Areas:**
- Board composition and diversity
- Meeting effectiveness
- Strategic oversight
- Financial oversight
- Risk management
- Stakeholder engagement

### 8.2 Term Limit Patterns

#### Why Term Limits Matter

**Benefits:**
- **Prevents stagnation** - Fresh perspectives regularly
- **Creates renewal opportunities** - Intentional board refreshment
- **Develops leadership pipeline** - Regular succession needs
- **Maintains energy and engagement** - Prevents burnout
- **Improves diversity** - Regular opportunities to improve representation

**Proactive vs. Reactive:**
- Term limits make refreshment proactive, not reactive
- "Re-up" conversations ensure intentional renewal
- No need for uncomfortable "asks to leave"

#### Common Term Limit Structures

**Board Level:**
- **3 years x 2 terms** = 6 years maximum (common for nonprofits)
- **4 years x 2 terms** = 8 years maximum (common for associations)
- **2 years x 3 terms** = 6 years maximum (encourages frequent evaluation)

**Committee Level:**
- **2-3 year terms** (aligns with board terms)
- **1 year terms for task forces** (time-limited projects)
- **Unlimited terms for advisory committees** (expertise-driven)

**Officer Level:**
- **1-2 year terms** (prevents entrenchment)
- **Automatic succession** (VP → President → Past President)
- **Maximum officer years** (e.g., 6 years total in officer roles)

#### Term Limit Best Practices

**System Design:**
- Each board/committee establishes its own system
- Document clearly in bylaws and charters
- Automatic tracking and notifications
- 90-day advance notice of term expiration

**Exceptions and Flexibility:**
- Waiver provision for extraordinary circumstances
- Cooling-off period before re-eligibility (e.g., 1 year off)
- Different limits for expertise-critical roles

**Transition Management:**
- Stagger terms so not all members cycle off simultaneously
- Ensure continuity through overlapping terms
- Plan succession before term limits trigger

### 8.3 Meeting Cadence Recommendations

#### Frequency by Committee Type

**Full Board:**
- **Quarterly minimum** (4 times per year)
- **Monthly or bi-monthly** for active organizations
- More frequent for crisis or high-growth periods

**Executive Committee:**
- **Monthly** (prepares board meeting agendas)
- Between full board meetings

**Audit Committee:**
- **Quarterly minimum** (regulatory requirement for some)
- Before each quarterly earnings release (public companies)
- Additional meetings as needed for auditor interaction

**Finance Committee:**
- **Quarterly minimum**
- Monthly during budget development
- Before board meetings to review financials

**Governance/Nominating Committee:**
- **Quarterly**
- More frequent during election seasons
- As-needed for urgent governance matters

**Program/Standing Committees:**
- **At least quarterly**
- Monthly or more for active projects
- Depends on organizational stage and activity level

**Task Forces/Ad Hoc Committees:**
- **As needed** based on project timeline
- Weekly or bi-weekly during active phases
- Sunset when purpose fulfilled

#### Meeting Cadence Best Practices

**Consistency Matters:**
- Regular schedule helps attendance (e.g., "first Tuesday of each month")
- Same day/time reduces scheduling conflicts
- Calendar year in advance

**Avoid Catch-All Meetings:**
- "Quarterly check-ins instead of annual catch-all meetings keeps governance top-of-mind"
- Regular touchpoints > infrequent marathon meetings
- Focused agendas for each meeting

**Flexibility When Needed:**
- Cancel if no substantive business (don't meet for the sake of meeting)
- Add special meetings for urgent matters
- Virtual meetings for geographically distributed members

**Timing Considerations:**
- Avoid holiday seasons and summer if attendance suffers
- Align with fiscal calendar for financial committees
- Consider member availability (e.g., avoid Monday mornings for volunteer boards)

### 8.4 Document Retention Policies

#### Retention Period Standards

**Permanent Retention:**
- Corporate charter and bylaws
- Board and committee meeting minutes
- Audit reports
- Tax returns (or 7+ years)
- Property records

**7+ Years:**

#### Conflict Resolution Rule

**When Retention Periods Conflict:**
- **Retain for the GREATEST period** among conflicting requirements
- Example: If federal law requires 3 years but state law requires 7 years, retain for 7 years
- Document the rationale for retention period chosen

#### Secure Disposal Requirements

**Disposal Methods:**
- **Paper documents** - Shredding or pulping
- **Electronic documents** - Secure deletion (overwriting, not just recycle bin)
- **Confidential materials** - Witnessed destruction with certificate

**Timing:**
- Expired records MUST be disposed of per policy
- Annual review of records for disposal eligibility
- Document destruction log

#### Committee-Specific Retention

**Meeting Materials:**
- Approved minutes: Permanent
- Draft minutes: Until approved, then destroy
- Board packets: Retain with minutes (permanent)
- Pre-meeting materials: Retain with minutes if referenced in decisions
- Informal notes: Destroy after minutes approved (not official record)

**Conflict of Interest:**

**Best Practice:** "A yearly cycle alone isn't sufficient"

#### Disclosure Form Content

**Information to Capture:**
- **Financial interests in vendors:**
  - Entity name
  - Ownership percentage
  - Nature of relationship (owner, employee, board member, investor, family member)
  - Estimated annual transaction value
- **Relationships with grantees/beneficiaries:**
  - Nature of relationship
  - Financial interest
- **Family member relationships:**
  - Family member's role in vendor/partner organizations
- **Other potential conflicts:**
  - Competing organizations
  - Personal interests that could appear as conflicts

**Specificity Required:**
- Vague disclosures not sufficient
- Detailed information enables proper evaluation
- Updates required when relationships change

#### Conflict Management Process

**Step 1: Disclosure**
